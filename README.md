Backbone.ViewKit
===

Backbone.ViewKit is a Backbone plugin for managing views and view transitions, geared primarily toward mobile applications.  The view management is largely inspired by some of the components from the [iOS UIKit framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/uikit_framework/_index.html).
